## Introduction

This project will consist of a program that, given a photograph, guesses what the weather depicted in the photograph is. It will achieve this using a Convolutional Neural Network.

I left the dataset out of the repository because it was too large. You can download it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset/data). The weather folders should then be put in the dataset folder.

I am currently preparing this project as part of my internship at Turkcell Communication Services, where I was tasked to implement a program performing image classification.

## Running

- To regenerate images.npz, which holds normalized image data, run `imageresizer.py`. The dataset needs to be installed to run this program.
